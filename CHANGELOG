## IDEAS ##

add a timeout function for MaxPlayers
add a command to check if timeout is enabled
change all delays to be customizable to any denomination EX: 2h 5m
    pseudo code:
    split config by spaces, and search for h m s in split array
    have a total second variable storing the sum of the 3 types
show a reminder that server is in timeout mode
